# Cardio-Vascular-Risk-Prediction-Using-Retinal--Image
Address the need for early detection of cardiovascular diseases using non-invasive methods.
1.Global Health Burden:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide.
Early and accurate risk prediction is critical to reducing mortality rates.
2.Limitations of Existing Risk Models:
Current CVD risk models depend mainly on clinical factors (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, age).
Many assessments require invasive tests, which may not be accessible to all populations.
3.Need for Non-Invasive Alternatives:
Retinal imaging offers a non-invasive method to assess cardiovascular health.
Despite its potential, retinal imaging is underutilized in CVD risk prediction.
4.Research Challenge:
Develop robust and validated deep learning models that can analyze retinal images.
Aim to predict CVD risk with high accuracy.
5.Research Objective:
Bridge the gap by creating a reliable, non-invasive CVD prediction tool.
Validate across diverse populations to ensure broader clinical applicability.
