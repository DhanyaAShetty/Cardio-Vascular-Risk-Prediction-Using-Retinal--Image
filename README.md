# Cardio-Vascular-Risk-Prediction-Using-Retinal--Image
Address the need for early detection of cardiovascular diseases using non-invasive methods.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the
critical need for early and accurate risk prediction. Existing CVD risk models primarily rely on
clinical factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and age, often requiring invasive tests that
may not be accessible to all populations. Retinal imaging presents a non-invasive alternative for
assessing cardiovascular health, yet its potential in predicting CVD risk is not fully realized. The
challenge is to develop robust and validated deep learning models capable of analyzing retinal
images to predict CVD risk with high accuracy. This research seeks to bridge the gap by creating a
reliable, non-invasive CVD prediction tool using retinal images, validated across diverse
populationsfor broader clinical application
